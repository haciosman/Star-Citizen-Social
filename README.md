# Star Citizen Social
Hello everyone.
We are working on a social media platform for star citizen created by the community. Our page has been active in beta for about a few months and we are working together with you, our valued players, to both use and develop our page.Our difference from forum sites is that our site has a social media page.The purpose here is that although our page may seem like a mix of Instagram and Facebook, the only difference is that it is a page created specifically for Star Citizen players and only tries to bring together Star Citizen posts and player communities.Although it is in beta, we would like to point out that there will be many updates in the future and we are working hard.We wholeheartedly believe that we will reach even better places with the support of our valuable players.
